# Async/Await

The `async` and `await` keywords provide syntactic sugar for promises that mean
they’re no longer an API construct, the JavaScript language itself has been updated to
support promises.

It is important to mention that async/await is just a wrapper to restyle code, making promises easier to read and use in certain circumstances. At it's core, async/await still uses promises. If you’re unsure of how promises work or need a better understanding of asynchronism in JavaScript, check out this overview.

## Scope - Async/Await

- The entire wrapper function is asynchronous

## Logic - Async/Await

- Synchronous needs to be moved out of the callback

- Multiple promises can be handled with simple variables

## Error Handling - Async/Await

- Try

- Catch

- Finally
