# Async/Await

It is important to mention that async/await is just a wrapper to restyle code, making promises easier to read and use in certain circumstances. At it's core, async/await still uses promises. If you’re unsure of how promises work or need a better understanding of asynchronism in JavaScript, check out this overview.

## Scope - Async/Await

- The entire wrapper function is asynchronous

## Logic - Async/Await

- Synchronous needs to be moved out of the callback

- Multiple promises can be handled with simple variables

## Error Handling - Async/Await

- Try

- Catch

- Finally
