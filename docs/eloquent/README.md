# Chapter 1. Basic JavaScript: Values, Variables, and Control Flow
 
There are 6 basic types of values in javascript

- numbers
- strings
- Booleans
- objects
- functions
- undefined

“As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind only a few bits. These bits are recycled to make the next generation of values.”
Excerpt From: Haverbeke, Marijn. “Eloquent JavaScript.” iBooks.
