# Microservices

## In the Real World

Microservices are small software components that are specialized in one task and
work together to achieve a higher-level task. Forget about software for a second and
think about how a company works. When someone applies for a job in a company,
he applies for a given position: software engineer, system administrator, office
manager. The reason for this can be summarized in one word: specialization. If you
are used to work as a software engineer, you will get better with the experience and
add more value to the company. The fact that you don't know how to deal with a
customer, won't affect your performance as that is not your area of expertise and will
hardly add any value to your day-to-day work.
